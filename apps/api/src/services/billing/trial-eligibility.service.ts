 *
 * "One trial per customer, for life": any prior subscription that was
 * authorized by the provider at least once — any authorized status (active,
 * trialing, cancelled, comp, past_due, ...), any product domain (accommodation
 * or commerce) — disqualifies. A user who has never checked out at all (e.g.
 * every user on the implicit `tourist-free` default, which never creates a
 * `billing_subscriptions` row) is eligible — and so is one whose only rows are
 * `abandoned` / never-authorized `pending_provider` checkouts they backed out
 * of (HOS-230), since those never granted a trial.

 *   authorized the preapproval. The share-link flow creates it with no provider
 *   id (see `createPendingProviderSubscription`); the qzpay `mode:'paid'` inline

 * - `abandoned` — a `pending_provider` row whose checkout TTL elapsed with no
 *   provider authorization. Terminal; only ever reached FROM `pending_provider`.
 *   May still CARRY a provider id: the `abandoned-pending-subs` cron cancels and
 *   verifies the preapproval but does not clear the id column. The qzpay raw
 *   equivalent is `incomplete_expired`.
 *
 * A row in either state means the customer merely opened (and backed out of)
 * the MercadoPago screen — they never actually had a trial, so it must NOT
 * consume their one-per-lifetime trial eligibility.
 *
 * Membership is checked against the NORMALIZED status (see
 * {@link normalizeStoredSubscriptionStatus}), because `getByCustomerId` returns
 * the raw stored string and `billing_subscriptions.status` holds two
 * vocabularies (qzpay `incomplete`/`incomplete_expired` from the `mode:'paid'`
 * flow, Hospeda `pending_provider`/`abandoned` from the share-link/webhook/cron
 * paths). Checking raw values would miss the qzpay half and re-open this bug for
