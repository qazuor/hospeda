## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Agent Delegation Policy

**üö´ THE COORDINATING AGENT MUST NEVER DO THE WORK DIRECTLY**

### Mandatory Rules

1. **ALWAYS Analyze First**: Before starting ANY step, identify which specialized agents are needed
2. **ALWAYS Use Task Tool**: Delegate ALL work to specialized agents using Task tool
3. **NEVER Create Documents**: The coordinating agent NEVER creates PDR.md, tech-analysis.md, or TODOs.md
4. **NEVER Assume Capability**: Never assume you can do the work because "you understand it"

### Required Agent Mapping

| Task | Required Agent | Tool to Use |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| Create PDR.md | `product-functional` | Task tool with subagent_type="product-functional" |
| Create UI mockups | `ui-ux-designer` | Task tool with subagent_type="ui-ux-designer" |
| Create tech-analysis.md | `product-technical` | Task tool with subagent_type="product-technical" |
| Create TODOs.md | `product-technical` | Task tool with subagent_type="product-technical" |
| Final review | `tech-lead` | Task tool with subagent_type="tech-lead" |

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

‚ùå **WRONG:**
```text
"I'll create the PDR since the requirements are clear..."
"Let me write the technical analysis directly..."
"I can break this down into tasks myself..."
```

‚úÖ **CORRECT:**
```text
"Analyzing requirements... I will invoke the following agents:
1. product-functional for PDR creation
2. product-technical for tech-analysis
3. product-technical for task breakdown

Starting with Task tool to invoke product-functional agent..."
```

### Workflow Start Template

Every Phase 1 planning session MUST start with:

```text
üìã Feature Planning: [Feature Name]

Step 0: Agent Analysis
I will coordinate the following specialized agents:

1. ü§ñ product-functional
   - Create PDR with user stories and acceptance criteria
   - Duration: 1-2 hours

2. üé® ui-ux-designer [if UI-heavy]
   - Create mockups and wireframes
   - Duration: 30min-1h

3. üîß product-technical
   - Create tech-analysis with architecture design
   - Duration: 1-2 hours

4. üîß product-technical
   - Create TODOs with atomic task breakdown
   - Duration: 1-2 hours

5. üë®‚Äçüíº tech-lead
   - Final review and approval
   - Duration: 30min

Total estimated time: 4-8 hours (with user interaction)

Proceeding with Step 1: Initialize Context...
```

---

## Overview

**Phase 1** is the planning and design phase where we create a comprehensive, atomic plan ready for implementation.

**Duration:** 2-6 hours (depending on feature complexity)

**Key Principle:** Plan thoroughly before coding. Good planning saves time in implementation.

**Key Principle:** ALWAYS delegate to specialized agents. NEVER do the work directly.

---

## Goals

### Primary Goals

1. **Define Requirements**: Clear user stories with acceptance criteria
2. **Design Solution**: Technical approach and architecture
3. **Break Down Work**: Atomic tasks with estimates
4. **Identify Risks**: Technical and business risks with mitigations
5. **Get Approval**: User approval before implementation begins

### Success Metrics

- ‚úÖ All acceptance criteria defined and testable
- ‚úÖ All tasks are atomic (1-2 hours each)
- ‚úÖ Dependencies identified and documented
- ‚úÖ Technical approach validated
- ‚úÖ User approves plan

---

## Process

### Step 1: Initialize Context

**Duration:** 5 minutes

**Action:**

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/sessions/planning/{feature_name}
cd .claude/sessions/planning/{feature_name}
```text

**Files to Create:**

- `PDR.md` (from template)
- `tech-analysis.md` (from template)
- `TODOs.md` (from template)

**Command:**

```text
/start-feature-plan
```text

---

### Step 2: Functional Specification (PDR Generation)

**Duration:** 1-2 hours

**Agent:** `product-functional`

**Activities:**

1. **Understand the Problem**
   - What problem are we solving?
   - Who is affected?
   - Why does this matter?

2. **Create User Stories**

   ```

   As a [user type]
   I want to [action]
   So that [benefit]

   ```

3. **Define Acceptance Criteria**

   ```

   Given [precondition]
   When [action]
   Then [expected result]

   ```

   **Rules:**

   - Each criterion must be testable
   - Use specific, measurable language
   - Cover happy path AND edge cases

4. **Create Mockups/Wireframes**
   - Low fidelity for simple features
   - High fidelity for complex UI
   - Show all states (default, loading, error, success)
   - Mobile + Desktop views

5. **Define Constraints**
   - Performance requirements
   - Security requirements
   - Accessibility requirements (WCAG AA)
   - Browser support

**Deliverable:** Complete `PDR.md` sections 1-4

### Step 4: Task Breakdown (Only After Tech Analysis Approval)

**Duration:** 1-2 hours

**Agent:** `product-technical`

**Prerequisites:**

- ‚úÖ PDR approved by user
- ‚úÖ Tech analysis approved by user
- ‚úÖ Architecture decisions finalized

**Activities:**

1. **Identify Phases**
   - Phase 1: Planning (already done)
   - Phase 2: Implementation
   - Phase 3: Validation
   - Phase 4: Finalization

2. **Break Down Phase 2 by Layer**

   ```
   Phase 2: Implementation
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Database Layer
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Service Layer
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ API Layer
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Frontend Layer
   ```

3. **Create Tasks per Layer**

   Follow **entity creation order**:

   - Zod schemas
   - Types (z.infer)
   - Drizzle schema
   - Model
   - Service
   - API routes

4. **Subdivide into Atomic Tasks**

   Each task should be:

   - 1-2 hours duration
   - Single responsibility
   - Independently testable
   - Clear definition of done

5. **Estimate Each Task**

   Consider:

   - Complexity
   - Similar past work
   - Testing time
   - Buffer (20%)

6. **Identify Dependencies**

   ```
   Task A (no dependencies)
   Task B (depends on Task A)
   Task C (depends on Task B)
   ```

7. **Assign Priorities**
   - P0: Critical (must have)
   - P1: High (should have)
   - P2: Medium (nice to have)
   - P3: Low (could have)

**Deliverable:** Complete `TODOs.md` with task breakdown

---

### ‚ö™ OPTIONAL CHECKPOINT 3: Task Breakdown Review

**Optional User Interaction (Recommended)**

**Agent Responsibilities:**

1. **Present Task Breakdown** to user:

   ```text
   Task Breakdown Complete!

   I've created {n} atomic tasks organized in {m} phases:

   Summary:
   - Total tasks: {n}
   - P0 (Critical): {x} tasks
   - P1 (High): {y} tasks
   - P2+ (Nice to have): {z} tasks
   - Estimated total: {hours}h ({days} days)

   Key phases:
   - Phase 2.1 - Database Layer: {n} tasks ({h}h)
   - Phase 2.2 - Service Layer: {n} tasks ({h}h)
   - Phase 2.3 - API Layer: {n} tasks ({h}h)
   - Phase 2.4 - Frontend Layer: {n} tasks ({h}h)

   All tasks are atomic (1-2 hours each) and dependencies are mapped.

   Would you like to review the task breakdown before we proceed to Phase 2?
   (yes/no/let's start)
   ```

2. **If User Wants to Review:**
   - Discuss task estimates
   - Adjust priorities if needed
   - Clarify task descriptions
   - Address concerns about scope

3. **If User Approves or Skips:**
   - Proceed to Phase 2 Implementation
   - Start with first P0 task

**Note:** This checkpoint is optional because user has already approved the technical approach, which defines the task scope

---

### Step 5: Iterative Refinement

**Duration:** 30 minutes - 1 hour

**Thinking Modes:**

1. **System 2 Thinking** (Deep Analysis)
   - Review each task carefully
   - Is it truly atomic (1-2 hours)?
   - Does it have clear acceptance criteria?
   - Can it be tested independently?

2. **Tree of Thoughts** (Multiple Approaches)
   - Consider alternative breakdowns
   - Evaluate tradeoffs
   - Choose optimal approach
   - Document why chosen

3. **Iterative Refinement** (Polish)
   - Look for edge cases
   - Check for missed tasks
   - Verify dependencies
   - Ensure consistency

**Process:**

1. **Review All Tasks**
   - Are any > 2 hours? ‚Üí Break down further
   - Are any < 30 minutes? ‚Üí Consider combining
   - Missing tests? ‚Üí Add test tasks
   - Clear descriptions? ‚Üí Improve wording

2. **Check Dependencies**
   - All dependencies identified?
   - Any circular dependencies? ‚Üí Fix
   - Can tasks be parallelized? ‚Üí Mark as parallel

3. **Verify Completeness**
   - All layers covered?
   - All entity creation steps?
   - Documentation tasks?
   - Testing tasks?
   - QA tasks?

4. **Validate Estimates**
   - Sum of tasks = reasonable total?
   - Matches complexity estimate?
   - Buffer included?

5. **Re-analyze Entire Plan**
   - Read through from start
   - Look for gaps
   - Check for problems
   - Repeat until 100% confident

**Goal:** Be completely confident that the plan is:

- Complete
- Accurate
- Actionable
- Realistic

```text

**Wait for Approval:**

- If approved ‚Üí Proceed to Phase 2
- If changes needed ‚Üí Iterate on plan
- If rejected ‚Üí Re-analyze approach

**Never proceed without explicit user approval**

---

### Step 9: Sync to Linear (Optional)

**Duration:** 2-5 minutes

**After user approves the plan**, offer to sync with Linear:

```text
Great! The plan is approved.

Would you like me to sync this planning to Linear?

This will:
‚úÖ Create a parent issue: [Planning] {Feature Name}
‚úÖ Create sub-issues for all {n} tasks
‚úÖ Allow you to track progress from any device
‚úÖ Update status automatically as you complete tasks

Sync to Linear? (yes/no)
```

**If User Says Yes:**

1. Run `/sync-planning` command
2. Present sync results with URLs
3. Remind user to commit `issues-sync.json`

**If User Says No:**

1. Skip sync
2. Continue to Phase 2

**Note:** User can always run `/sync-planning` manually later.

**See**: [Sync Planning Command](./../commands/sync-planning.md) for details

---

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Rushing Planning

**Problem:** Skipping planning to "start coding faster"

**Consequence:** Rework, missed requirements, technical debt

**Solution:** Invest time in thorough planning

---

### Pitfall 2: Vague Requirements

**Problem:**

```text
User Story: User should be able to book accommodation
Acceptance Criteria: It should work
```text

**Solution:**

```text
User Story: As a guest, I want to book an accommodation
for specific dates so that I can plan my trip

Acceptance Criteria:

- Given accommodation is available for selected dates

  When I select check-in and check-out dates
  Then I can proceed to booking

- Given accommodation is NOT available

  When I try to book
  Then I see "Not available" message with alternative dates
```text

---

### Pitfall 3: Large Tasks

**Problem:**

```text
Task: Build frontend [8h]
```text

**Solution:**

```text
Task: Create AccommodationList component [1h]
Task: Create AccommodationCard component [1h]
Task: Create AccommodationForm component [1.5h]
Task: Setup TanStack Query [1h]
Task: Integrate with API [1h]
Task: Write component tests [1.5h]
```text

---

### Pitfall 4: Missing Dependencies

**Problem:** Starting Task B before Task A is done

**Solution:** Map all dependencies explicitly

```text
Task A: Create model [1h]
  Dependencies: None

Task B: Create service [1h]
  Dependencies: Task A complete

Task C: Create API route [1h]
  Dependencies: Task B complete
```text

---

### Pitfall 5: No User Approval

**Problem:** Starting implementation without user approval

**Consequence:** Building wrong thing, wasted effort

**Solution:** Always get explicit approval before Phase 2

---

## Summary Checklist

Before moving to Phase 2:

- [ ] PDR.md complete and approved
- [ ] tech-analysis.md complete and reviewed
- [ ] TODOs.md with atomic tasks
- [ ] All tasks 1-2 hours
- [ ] Dependencies mapped
- [ ] Estimates realistic
- [ ] Risks identified
- [ ] User explicitly approved plan
- [ ] 100% confident plan is complete

---

**Remember: Time spent planning is NOT wasted. It prevents wasted time in implementation.**
