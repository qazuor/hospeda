# System Diagrams

This directory contains Mermaid diagrams visualizing the Hospeda workflow system architecture.

## Available Diagrams

### 1. Workflow Decision Tree

**File:** [workflow-decision-tree.mmd](./workflow-decision-tree.mmd)

**Purpose:** Visual guide for selecting the appropriate workflow level

**Shows:**
- Decision criteria for each workflow level
- Level 1 (Quick Fix): < 30min, 1-2 files, very low risk
- Level 2 (Atomic Task): 30min-3h, 2-10 files, low-medium risk
- Level 3 (Feature Planning): Multi-day, architecture, DB changes
- Step counts for each level
- Color-coded paths (green=quick, orange=atomic, blue=feature)

**Use When:**
- Starting a new task
- Uncertain which workflow to use
- Training new team members
- Documenting workflow selection

### 2. Agent Hierarchy

**File:** [agent-hierarchy.mmd](./agent-hierarchy.mmd)

**Purpose:** Visual organization of the 13 consolidated agents

**Shows:**
- User/Principal Architect at top
- tech-lead as central coordinator
- 5 teams:
  - Product (product-technical)
  - Backend Team (hono-engineer, db-engineer)
  - Frontend Team (astro-engineer, tanstack-start-engineer, react-senior-dev)
  - Quality & Specialized (qa-engineer, security-engineer, performance-engineer)
  - Support Team (tech-writer, debugger)
- Reporting lines
- Color-coded by team

**Use When:**
- Understanding agent responsibilities
- Assigning tasks to agents
- Documenting team structure
- Planning agent collaboration

### 3. Tools Relationship

**File:** [tools-relationship.mmd](./tools-relationship.mmd)

**Purpose:** Show how commands, agents, and skills interact

**Shows:**
- 3 layers:
  - Commands Layer (16 commands)
  - Agents Layer (13 agents)
  - Skills Layer (16 skills)
- Flow: Commands → Agents → Skills
- Relationships between specific tools
- Command categories (Quality, Planning, Audit, Meta, Dev)
- Agent groups (Lead, Backend, Frontend, Quality, Support)
- Skill categories (Testing, Development, Design, Utils)

**Use When:**
- Understanding system architecture
- Finding which agent uses which skill
- Documenting tool relationships
- Planning new tools

**View:**
```mermaid
# Paste content from tools-relationship.mmd
```

### 4. Documentation Map

**File:** [documentation-map.mmd](./documentation-map.mmd)

**Purpose:** Navigate the `.claude/` directory structure

**Shows:**
- Main directories:
  - `agents/` - Agent definitions (13)
  - `commands/` - Command definitions (16)
  - `skills/` - Skill definitions (16)
  - `docs/` - Documentation
  - `sessions/` - Planning & tasks
- Subdirectories and organization
- Key files (README.md, REGISTRY.md, etc.)
- Session structures (P-004, PB-XXX)
- Color-coded by type

**Use When:**
- Finding specific documentation
- Understanding directory structure
- Adding new documentation
- Navigating the system
