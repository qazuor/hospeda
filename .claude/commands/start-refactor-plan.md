# Start Refactor Plan Command

## Purpose

Plan comprehensive refactoring work safely with risk assessment, incremental steps, and test validation strategy. Ensures refactoring maintains system stability while improving code quality.

## Usage

```bash
/start-refactor-plan {refactor_scope}
```text

## Description

Orchestrates safe refactoring planning by analyzing current code, identifying issues, creating step-by-step refactoring plan, and establishing validation strategy. Emphasizes incremental changes with continuous testing to maintain system stability.

- Performance impact analysis
- Deployment strategy
- User impact assessment

**Deliverable**: Complete refactor strategy document

### Step 4: Incremental Step Breakdown

**Agent**: `product-technical` (with safety focus)

**Process**:

- Break refactor into safe, atomic steps
- Ensure each step maintains functionality
- Plan comprehensive test validation for each step
- Identify checkpoint and rollback points
- Create dependency-aware ordering

**Step Requirements**:

- Each step ≤ 2 hours of work
- Functionality preserved after each step
- Tests pass after each step
- Rollback possible from any point
- Clear validation criteria

**Deliverable**: Detailed step-by-step refactor plan with validation points

### Step 5: Test Strategy Enhancement

**Agent**: `qa-engineer` with `web-app-testing` skill

**Process**:

- Assess current test coverage for refactor scope
- Identify missing tests that need addition
- Plan regression test strategy
- Design integration test improvements
- Create test execution plan for each refactor step

**Test Strategy Components**:

- Pre-refactor test baseline establishment
- Step-by-step test validation plan
- Regression test suite enhancement
- Performance benchmark testing
- User acceptance testing plan

**Deliverable**: Comprehensive testing strategy for safe refactoring

### Step 6: Risk Assessment and Approval

**Agent**: `tech-lead`

**Process**:

- Review complete refactor plan
- Assess technical risks and benefits
- Validate incremental approach safety
- Approve refactor strategy
- Sign off on execution plan

**Risk Assessment**:

- Business continuity impact
- Technical complexity assessment
- Resource requirement validation
- Timeline feasibility review
- Rollback strategy validation

**Deliverable**: Risk assessment and approval for refactor execution

### Risk Assessment Example

```text
🚨 RISK ASSESSMENT

HIGH RISK AREAS:
❌ User authentication flow (critical path)
   Risk: Session invalidation during refactor
   Mitigation: Feature flag for gradual rollout

⚠️ Database query optimization (performance impact)
   Risk: Query performance degradation
   Mitigation: Performance benchmarks at each step

LOW RISK AREAS:
✅ Internal service abstractions (isolated)
✅ Type system improvements (compile-time validation)
✅ Code organization (no runtime impact)

ROLLBACK STRATEGY:

- Checkpoint every 5 steps
- Feature flags for user-facing changes
- Database migration rollback scripts
- Performance monitoring with automatic rollback triggers
