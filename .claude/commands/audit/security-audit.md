# Security Audit Command

## Purpose

Performs a comprehensive security audit of the codebase, combining vulnerability assessment, penetration testing simulation, and security best practices validation. This command replaces the deprecated `/review-security` and `/pen-test` commands with a unified, thorough security analysis.

## When to Use

- **Before Production Deployment**: Validate security before going live
- **After Security-Related Changes**: Audit authentication, authorization, or data handling modifications
- **Regular Security Reviews**: Quarterly or after significant feature additions
- **Post-Incident Analysis**: After security incidents or vulnerability reports
- **Compliance Requirements**: When security documentation is needed

## Usage

```bash
/security-audit [options]
```

### Options

- `--scope <area>`: Focus audit on specific area (auth, api, database, frontend, all)
- `--depth <level>`: Analysis depth (quick, standard, thorough)
- `--report`: Generate detailed security-audit-report.md
- `--fix-suggestions`: Include automated fix suggestions

### Examples

```bash
/security-audit                           # Standard full audit
/security-audit --scope auth --depth thorough --report
/security-audit --scope api --fix-suggestions
```

- [ ] CSRF token bypass attempts
- [ ] Authentication bypass tests
- [ ] Authorization escalation tests
- [ ] Path traversal tests
- [ ] File inclusion tests

## Integration with Workflow

### Phase 3 - Validation

This command should be run during Phase 3 (Validation) of the feature workflow:

1. After implementation complete
2. Before deployment
3. As part of `/quality-check` comprehensive validation

### CI/CD Integration

Can be integrated into GitHub Actions for automated security checks:

```yaml
- name: Security Audit
  run: claude /security-audit --report
```

## Best Practices

1. **Run Before Every Deployment**: Make security audits mandatory
2. **Address Critical Issues Immediately**: Never deploy with critical vulnerabilities
3. **Track Findings Over Time**: Monitor security improvement trends
4. **Educate Team**: Share findings to improve security awareness
5. **Regular Audits**: Schedule quarterly comprehensive audits
6. **Update Regularly**: Keep security patterns current with threats
