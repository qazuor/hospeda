## Breaking Changes

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

**Agent System:**

- 12 agents removed/consolidated → Update any direct agent references
- Agent responsibilities redistributed → Review agent selection logic

**Command Naming:**

- Audit commands now prefixed with `/audit:` → Update command invocations
- Meta commands now prefixed with `/meta:` → Update command invocations

**Documentation Structure:**

- Learnings moved from CLAUDE.md to individual files → Update documentation links

3. Check decision-tree.md for workflow selection

**Step 2: Update References**

1. Replace security/performance/accessibility auditor calls with new commands
2. Update skill invocations for testing (api-app-testing, web-app-testing)
3. Update documentation links if embedding in custom docs

**Step 3: Validate System**

```bash
# Run all validation scripts
pnpm claude:validate:docs
pnpm claude:validate:schemas
pnpm claude:sync:registry

2. Try Level 2 workflow with a small task
3. Review Level 3 workflow phases (no need to execute yet)

**Step 5: Configure Hooks (Optional)**
