## Conclusion

**Status**: System is ~60% complete

**Key Finding**: Database layer is solid (100%), but Models layer needs completion before proceeding to Services.

**Critical Path**:
1. Complete missing 15 models (19-26 hours)
2. Validate quality (2-3 hours)
3. Begin Services layer (50-70 hours)

**Risk**: Low - Architecture is sound, just needs execution

**Confidence**: High - Clear path forward with well-defined tasks
