# Migration Analysis: Commit-to-Main ‚Üí PR-Based + Git Worktrees Workflow

## Executive Summary

### Current State

The Hospeda project currently operates with a **mixed workflow**:

- Some documentation exists for PR-based workflow (`.claude/docs/guides/pr-workflow.md`, `.claude/docs/guides/git-worktrees.md`)
- Worktree creation scripts exist (`.claude/scripts/worktree-create.sh`, `.claude/scripts/worktree-cleanup.sh`)
- **However**: Agents, commands, skills, and workflow docs still contain significant references and assumptions about direct commits to main
- No enforcement mechanism exists to prevent direct commits to main
- No PR creation automation in workflows

### Target State

**ALL development through PRs in feature branches using Git Worktrees:**

- Every code change happens in a feature branch worktree
- PRs are created before merging to main
- Automated CI/CD runs on PRs
- Main branch is protected
- Agents understand and instruct PR workflow
- Commands integrate PR creation
- Worktree awareness throughout tooling

### Migration Scope

**Files Requiring Updates:** 100+ files
**Estimated Total Effort:** 24-32 hours
**Risk Level:** Medium-High (can break developer workflow if not done carefully)
**Breaking Changes:** Multiple (scripts, agent instructions, command outputs)

## 1. Code & Scripts Analysis

### 1.1 Shell Scripts (`.claude/scripts/`)

#### `.claude/scripts/worktree-create.sh`

**Status:** ‚úÖ Already worktree-aware
**Lines:** 1-64
**Assessment:** Properly creates worktrees, no changes needed

#### `.claude/scripts/worktree-cleanup.sh`

**Status:** ‚úÖ Already worktree-aware
**Lines:** 1-82
**Issues Found:**

- **Line 13-15:** Assumes main branch exists and is tracked
  - **Risk:** Low
  - **Fix Needed:** Add check if `origin/main` exists before pull
  - **Priority:** P2 (Medium)

**Recommended Change:**

```bash
# Line 13-15
echo "üì° Fetching latest changes..."
git fetch origin main
if git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/heads/main; then
  git checkout main
  git pull origin main
else
  echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Main branch not found locally"
fi
```

#### `.claude/scripts/sync-registry.sh`

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Worktree-compatible but doesn't consider context
**Lines:** 1-41
**Issues:** None critical
**Priority:** P3 (Low)

#### `.claude/scripts/health-check.sh`

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Assumes single project instance
**Lines:** 48-343
**Issues Found:**

- **Line 49:** `cd "$(dirname "$0")/../.."` - Assumes executed from project root
  - **Risk:** Medium - Will fail if run from worktree
  - **Fix:** Detect git root dynamically
  - **Priority:** P1 (High)

**Recommended Change:**

```bash
# Line 48-49
# Change to git repository root (works in worktrees)
GIT_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)
if [ -z "$GIT_ROOT" ]; then
  echo "‚ùå Error: Not in a git repository"
  exit 1
fi
cd "$GIT_ROOT"
```

#### `.claude/hooks/on-notification.sh`

**Status:** ‚úÖ Worktree-compatible
**Lines:** 1-28
**Issues:** None
**Priority:** P3 (Low)

#### `.claude/tools/format-markdown.sh`

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Path assumptions
**Assessment:** Needs review for worktree compatibility
**Priority:** P2 (Medium)

### 1.2 TypeScript/JavaScript Scripts

#### `scripts/planning-sync.ts`

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs review
**Risk:** Likely uses `process.cwd()` which may not work correctly in worktrees
**Priority:** P1 (High)
**Assessment Needed:** Full file review required

#### `scripts/planning-complete-task.ts`

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs review
**Same issues as planning-sync.ts**
**Priority:** P1 (High)

#### `scripts/generate-api-prod-package.ts`

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs review
**Priority:** P2 (Medium)

#### `packages/github-workflow/` scripts

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è All need review for worktree compatibility
**Files:**

- `packages/github-workflow/examples/parse-planning-session.ts`
- `packages/github-workflow/examples/scan-code-comments.ts`
- `packages/github-workflow/src/parsers/*.ts`
- `packages/github-workflow/src/sync/*.ts`

**Priority:** P1 (High) - These are core workflow tools

### 1.3 Package.json Scripts

**File:** `package.json`
**Lines:** 17-62

#### Scripts That Need Review

**Git-related scripts:** None currently

**Scripts assuming project root:**

- All scripts using relative paths (line 29-46: db:*, line 55-56: planning:*)
- **Issue:** Most use `pnpm --filter` which should work in worktrees
- **Risk:** Low
- **Priority:** P3 (Low)

**Recommendations:**

- Add new scripts for PR workflow:
  - `pr:create` - Create PR from current branch
  - `pr:update` - Update PR description
  - `wt:create` - Alias for worktree-create.sh
  - `wt:cleanup` - Alias for worktree-cleanup.sh
  - `wt:list` - List all worktrees

**Priority:** P1 (High)

```yaml
# Only on main branch
- Deploy to staging
- Run smoke tests
```

**Context:** CI/CD Pipeline section
**Fix Needed:** Change to "Only on merge to main" + add PR workflow instructions
**Priority:** P0 (Blocker)

**Missing Content:**

- No instructions on PR creation workflow (where in Phase 4?)
- No worktree usage guidance
- No instructions on branch naming
- Git operations assume single instance

**Recommended Additions:**

```markdown
### PR-Based Workflow Integration

#### Phase 2 - Implementation

**Before Starting:**

1. Verify you're in a worktree (not main branch)
2. If not, guide user to create worktree:
   ```bash
   ./.claude/scripts/worktree-create.sh <branch-name> main
   ```

#### Phase 4 - Finalization

**Commit & PR Creation:**

1. Generate conventional commits (existing process)
2. Push to remote:

   ```bash
   git push -u origin <branch-name>
   ```

3. Create PR:

   ```bash
   gh pr create --title "{title}" --body "{description}"
   ```

4. Link Linear issues in PR description
5. Request user review before merge

**Assessment:** Works correctly in all contexts
**Priority:** P3 (No change needed)

#### `.husky/post-checkout`

**Lines:** 65
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Update for Worktree Context

**Current Behavior:**

- Checks code registry consistency
- Validates JSON
- Checks staleness

**Issues:**

- Runs on every branch checkout
- In worktree workflow, might trigger unnecessarily
- Should differentiate between worktree checkout vs file checkout

**Current Check (line 11-14):**

```bash
# Only run on branch checkouts (not file checkouts)
if [ "$BRANCH_CHECKOUT" = "0" ]; then
  exit 0
fi
```

**Recommended Addition (after line 14):**

```bash
# Skip for worktree operations (worktrees share .git)
if [ -f .git ] && grep -q "gitdir:" .git 2>/dev/null; then
  # This is a worktree, registry is shared

# Worktree-specific
.worktree-local/
.vscode-workspace-*
```

**Priority:** P2 (Medium)

#### `.git/config`

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Branch Protection

**Recommended Addition:**

```bash
# Run once during migration
git config branch.main.mergeoptions "--no-ff"
```

**Priority:** P1 (High)

#### Repository Settings (GitHub)

**Priority:** P1 (High)

### 8.2 CLAUDE.md

**File:** `CLAUDE.md`
**Current State:** Extensive documentation (already read)

**Issues Found:**

**Section "6. Development Rules" > "Git & Commit Rules":**

- Has atomic commits policy (good!)
- Does NOT mention PR requirement
- Does NOT mention feature branch requirement

**Recommended Addition (after line ~400 in Git section):**

```markdown
### Branch & PR Policy

**CRITICAL: PR-Based Workflow**

- **NEVER** commit directly to `main` branch
- **ALWAYS** create feature branch worktree before starting work
- **ALWAYS** create Pull Request before merging to main

**Enforcement:**

- pre-commit hook prevents commits to main
- GitHub branch protection requires PR + review
- CI/CD only runs on PRs and main

**Workflow:**

```bash
# 1. Create feature worktree
./.claude/scripts/worktree-create.sh feature/my-feature main

# 2. Develop in worktree
cd ../hospeda-feature-my-feature

# 3. Commit changes
git add <files>
git commit -m "feat(scope): description"

# 4. Push to remote
git push -u origin feature/my-feature

# 5. Create PR
gh pr create --title "feat(scope): description" \
  --body "description"

# 6. After merge, cleanup
cd ../hospeda
./.claude/scripts/worktree-cleanup.sh
```

```

**Priority:** P0 (BLOCKER)

## 9. Breaking Changes Analysis

### 9.1 CRITICAL: Will Break Immediately

#### 1. Pre-commit Hook Update (`.husky/pre-commit`)

**What Breaks:**

- Developers cannot commit to main anymore
- Existing workflow of `git add . && git commit` on main fails

**Impact:** HIGH
**Users Affected:** ALL
**Workaround:** `git commit --no-verify` (not recommended)
**Timeline:** Must communicate BEFORE merging

#### 2. Atomic Task Protocol Changes

**What Breaks:**

- Current atomic task workflow starts with code changes
- New workflow requires worktree creation first
- Developers following old docs will be confused

**Impact:** MEDIUM
**Users Affected:** Developers using atomic tasks
**Timeline:** Must update docs BEFORE next atomic task

#### 3. Quality Check Command Changes

**What Breaks:**

- `/quality-check` doesn't create PR
- Developers expect complete workflow
- Missing PR creation causes confusion

**Impact:** MEDIUM
**Users Affected:** ALL (using quality-check)
**Timeline:** Update before Phase 3 validations

### 9.2 MEDIUM: Will Break Gradually

#### 4. Agent Instructions Misalignment

**What Breaks:**

- Agents give wrong instructions (commit to main)
- Inconsistent workflow guidance
- Confusion about PR creation

**Impact:** MEDIUM
**Users Affected:** All AI-assisted development
**Timeline:** Fix ASAP after main protection enabled

#### 5. Script Assumptions

**What Breaks:**

- Scripts assuming single instance
- Scripts using relative paths
- Health checks failing in worktrees

**Impact:** LOW-MEDIUM
**Users Affected:** Users running scripts
**Timeline:** Fix within first week

### 9.3 LOW: Edge Cases

#### 6. Husky Hooks in Worktrees

**What Breaks:**

- Hook execution timing
- Registry checks unnecessary in worktrees

**Impact:** LOW
**Users Affected:** Power users with multiple worktrees
**Timeline:** Can fix incrementally

## 14. Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Risk 1: Developers Unable to Work

**Scenario:** Branch protection blocks all work, team stuck

**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** Critical

**Mitigation:**

1. **Pre-Migration:**
   - Thorough testing in migration branch
   - Clear documentation available
   - Training session conducted

2. **During Migration:**
   - Team lead available for support
   - Slack channel monitored
   - Bypass option documented (`--no-verify`)

3. **Rollback Plan:**

   ```bash
   # Emergency rollback
   # 1. Disable GitHub branch protection
   # 2. Revert pre-commit hook
   git revert <commit-hash>
   git push origin main --no-verify
   ```

### Risk 2: CI/CD Breaks

**Scenario:** GitHub Actions don't trigger on PRs

**Probability:** Low
**Impact:** High

**Mitigation:**

1. **Pre-Migration:**
   - Review all GitHub Actions workflows
   - Ensure triggers include `pull_request`
   - Test with migration PR

2. **During Migration:**
   - Monitor first few PRs closely
   - Verify all checks run
   - Fix issues immediately

3. **Rollback Plan:**
   - Workflow files are version controlled
   - Revert workflow changes if needed

### Risk 3: Worktree Confusion

**Scenario:** Developers don't understand worktrees, make mistakes

**Probability:** High
**Impact:** Medium

**Mitigation:**

1. **Pre-Migration:**
   - Comprehensive documentation (already exists)
   - Training session with examples
   - Quick reference guide

2. **During Migration:**
   - Provide helper scripts (already exist)
   - Create aliases for common operations
   - Support channel for questions

3. **Common Issues Doc:**
   - Document common mistakes
   - Provide solutions
   - Update based on feedback

### Risk 4: Lost Work

**Scenario:** Developer work lost due to worktree issues

**Probability:** Low
**Impact:** Critical

**Mitigation:**

1. **Prevention:**
   - Encourage frequent commits
   - Encourage pushing to remote
   - Git never loses committed work

2. **Recovery:**
   - Git reflog can recover commits
   - Branches never deleted automatically
   - Support for recovery available

3. **Documentation:**
   - Recovery procedures documented
   - Common rescue commands provided

### Risk 5: Performance Issues

**Scenario:** Worktrees cause disk space or performance problems

**Probability:** Low
**Impact:** Medium

**Mitigation:**

1. **Monitoring:**
   - Watch disk space usage
   - Monitor pnpm cache size
   - Track node_modules duplication

2. **Optimization:**
   - pnpm shares packages (already configured)
   - Cleanup script removes old worktrees
   - Guidelines for worktree lifecycle

3. **Limits:**
   - Document recommended max worktrees (3-5)
   - Encourage cleanup after merge
   - Automate cleanup where possible

### Risk 6: Agent Instructions Inconsistent

**Scenario:** Some agents give old instructions, confusion ensues

**Probability:** High
**Impact:** Medium

**Mitigation:**

1. **Systematic Update:**
   - Use priority matrix
   - Update in order (P0 first)
   - Track completion

2. **Verification:**
   - Review each agent after update
   - Test with real scenarios
   - Get feedback from users

3. **Version Markers:**

### Appendix D: Troubleshooting

**Issue: "Cannot commit to main"**

**Cause:** Pre-commit hook blocking
**Solution:** Create feature worktree

```bash
./.claude/scripts/worktree-create.sh feature/<name> main
cd ../hospeda-feature-<name>
```

**Issue: "Worktree already exists"**

**Cause:** Branch checked out elsewhere
**Solution:** Remove old worktree first

```bash
git worktree list  # Find path
git worktree remove <path>
```

**Issue: "Cannot create PR"**

**Cause:** gh CLI not authenticated
**Solution:** Authenticate

```bash
gh auth login
```

**Issue: "CI checks not running"**

**Cause:** GitHub Actions not configured
**Solution:** Ensure workflow triggers include `pull_request`

**Issue: "Lost changes after switching worktrees"**

**Cause:** Changes not committed
**Solution:** Git never loses committed work

```bash
git reflog  # Find lost commits
git checkout <commit-hash>
```
