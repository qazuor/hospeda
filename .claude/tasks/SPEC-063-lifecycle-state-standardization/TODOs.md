# SPEC-063: Lifecycle State Standardization

## Progress: 27/63 tasks (42.9%)

**Last updated:** 2026-04-18T15:05:00Z
**Status:** in-progress (Phase 2 OwnerPromotion complete end-to-end including cron T-025/T-026; Phase 4 DestinationReview next)

### Follow-up SPECs spawned

- **SPEC-087** (draft) — public endpoint response schema strip (systemic factory fix). Discovered during T-022. Until SPEC-087 lands, SPEC-063 phase 3/4 public routes (T-035 DestinationReview, T-051 Sponsorship) use per-handler strip as established by T-022.

### Next up (in priority order)

1. **T-028** (complexity 2) — Update DestinationReview Drizzle DB schema: add lifecycleState column. First task of Phase 4 (critical path start).
2. After T-028: T-030 (Zod base schema), T-029 (migrations), T-032 (access schema lifecycleState admin-only — critical tier boundary), T-033 (query/HTTP schemas), T-034 (remove admin-search workaround).

Then Phase 4 (DestinationReview T-028..T-038), Phase 3 (Sponsorship T-039..T-057), cleanup T-058.

**Average Complexity:** 2.1/2.5 (ceiling)
**Critical Path (post-T-027):** T-028 -> T-030 -> T-034 -> T-035 -> T-038 -> T-039 -> T-040 -> T-042 -> T-058 (9 steps remaining)
**Parallel Tracks:** 3 identified (Phase 1 tests, Phase 2 migration, Phase 2 schemas after T-003)

  - AC-005-01: public endpoints only return ACTIVE records
  - Scope creep absorbed: also migrated `test/factories/ownerPromotionFactory.ts` (2 `isActive` refs); no other task covered it
  - Gap flagged: `_executeCount` NOT updated — to revisit with T-022
  - Blocked by: T-011 · Blocks: T-013, T-022, T-025

### API Routes + Integration

- [x] **T-013** (complexity: 2) — Update admin OwnerPromotion API routes
  - COMPLETED 2026-04-17 · verification-only task, 0 code changes
  - Routes live under `apps/api/src/routes/owner-promotion/admin/` (not `/admin/owner-promotion/` as description suggested); 0 `isActive` refs; consume already-updated Zod schemas (T-008/T-009/T-010)

  - Blocked by: T-011 · Blocks: T-024

### Admin Frontend

> **REPLAN 2026-04-17T17:55**: T-016 and T-018 split into granular sub-tasks after admin UI scope analysis revealed that the original tasks referenced dead code files and did not cover the live route, types, or dialog components. T-017 retained but scope refined (toggle -> rename+payload). See `progress.md` for details.

- [x] **T-016a** (complexity: 1.5) — Migrate OwnerPromotion local types
  - COMPLETED 2026-04-17 · lint: pass · typecheck: pass for SPEC-063
  - Scope absorbed: also migrated `OwnerPromotionFilters.status` -> `lifecycleState`

- [x] **T-016b** (complexity: 2) — Migrate OwnerPromotion column definition in admin route
  - COMPLETED 2026-04-17 · 3-variant badge (ACTIVE→success, DRAFT→secondary, ARCHIVED→outline)

- [x] **T-016c** (complexity: 1.5) — Delete OwnerPromotion dead code (4 files + index.ts cleanup)
  - COMPLETED 2026-04-17 · 4 files deleted + empty dirs + re-export removed

- [x] **T-016d** (complexity: 1.5) — Migrate OwnerPromotion test fixtures
  - COMPLETED 2026-04-17 · 3 refs migrated (isActive:true→ACTIVE, isActive:false→ARCHIVED)

- [x] **T-017** (complexity: 2.5) — Rename togglePromotionActive -> updatePromotionLifecycle
  - COMPLETED 2026-04-17 · payload `{ isActive }` → `{ lifecycleState }`; hook renamed to `useUpdatePromotionLifecycleMutation`
  - Backend: verified via T-010 (HTTP schema accepts lifecycleState in PATCH)

- [x] **T-018a** (complexity: 2) — Migrate OwnerPromotion admin filter state + dropdown
  - COMPLETED 2026-04-17 · filter state typed as `LifecycleStatusEnum`; dropdown has 4 options (all, DRAFT, ACTIVE, ARCHIVED)

- [x] **T-018b** (complexity: 2) — Migrate OwnerPromotion dialog components
  - COMPLETED 2026-04-17 · DetailDialog badge (3-variant) + FormDialog initial value + added native select field

- [x] **T-018c** (complexity: 2.5) — Migrate OwnerPromotion action handler
  - COMPLETED 2026-04-17 · inline `<select>` (native, consistent with existing filter/discountType selects); aria-label added

### i18n (partial)

- [x] **T-027** (complexity: 1.5) — i18n locale keys for OwnerPromotion lifecycle
  - COMPLETED 2026-04-17 · lint: pass · typecheck: pass · tests: admin-billing 1044/1044 pass
  - Session 1 (T-018 block): added `statusDraft`, `statusArchived`, `actions.changeLifecycle`, `form.lifecycleStateLabel` to 3 locales + regenerated types
  - Session 2 (this commit): **expanded sweep** (user-approved option 2) — removed 11 orphans inside `ownerPromotions`: `statusInactive`, `statusInactiveLabel`, `statusActiveLabel`, `actionActivate`, `actionDeactivate`, `actionEdit`, `actionDelete`, `actions.activate`, `actions.deactivate`, `filters.active`, `filters.inactive`. Grep confirmed zero consumers for all 11 in apps/admin.
  - Subtask "Add actionSet*" marked obsolete — T-018c resolved UX via native `<select>` without needing new keys
  - Blocked by: T-018c · Blocks: T-028

### Tests

- [x] **T-019** (complexity: 2) — Update OwnerPromotion schema + CRUD tests
  - COMPLETED 2026-04-17 · lint: pass · typecheck: pass (2 T-019 files clean; 5 remaining errors are T-020 scope) · tests: 73/73 pass
  - AC-002-01 coverage added at schema layer (accept DRAFT/ARCHIVED, default ACTIVE, reject invalid enum)
  - AC-002-02 enforced via `.strict()` on UpdateInputSchema
  - Blocked by: T-007, T-008 · Blocks: none

- [x] **T-020** (complexity: 2) — Update OwnerPromotion admin-search + group tests
  - COMPLETED 2026-04-17 · lint: pass · typecheck: **packages/schemas 100% clean for SPEC-063** · tests: 118/118 pass

  - Blocked by: T-009, T-010 · Blocks: none

- [x] **T-021** (complexity: 2) — Write OwnerPromotion admin list integration test (AC-001-01)
  - COMPLETED 2026-04-18 · lint: pass · typecheck: pass · tests: 5/5 pass
  - Strategy: module-level mock of `@repo/service-core` (same pattern as `accommodation/admin-search-filters.test.ts`)
  - 5 tests: DRAFT/ACTIVE/ARCHIVED accepted → 200, invalid status → 400 VALIDATION_ERROR, default → 'all'
  - Env gotcha: requires `apps/api/.env.test` (NOT `.env.local`), documented in state.json `_envGotcha`
  - Auth gotcha: mock actor needs ACCESS_PANEL_ADMIN + ACCESS_API_ADMIN on top of OWNER_PROMOTION_VIEW, documented in state.json `_authGotcha`
  - Scope bonus: +2 tests beyond original 4 subtasks (invalid rejection + default='all')
  - Blocked by: T-013 · Blocks: none

- [x] **T-022** (complexity: 2, effective ~2.5 with scope absorb) — Write OwnerPromotion public endpoint default ACTIVE test (AC-005-01)
  - COMPLETED 2026-04-18 · lint: pass · typecheck: pass · tests: 5/5 service unit + 5/5 integration
  - Strategy: service-level force-override (not just default) + service unit tests + integration pipeline mock + per-handler response strip
  - Scope absorbed: (1) security hardening `_executeSearch` force-override, (2) `_executeCount` force-override for pagination consistency, (3) service unit test file creation (new)
  - Systemic gap flagged: route factory does not runtime-parse responseSchema → per-handler strip in public/list.ts. Tracked in SPEC-087.
  - Blocked by: T-012 · Blocks: T-058

- [x] **T-023** (complexity: 2) — Update OwnerPromotion model tests for findActive methods
  - COMPLETED 2026-04-17 · lint: pass · typecheck: pass · tests: 19/19 pass
  - Path corrected: real file at `packages/db/test/models/ownerPromotion.model.test.ts` (no subdir)
  - Mock data shape migrated (isActive:true → lifecycleState:ACTIVE); SQL-exclusion verification delegated to T-022 integration
  - Blocked by: T-011 · Blocks: none

- [x] **T-024** (complexity: 2) — Write usage-tracking + limit-enforcement tests
  - COMPLETED 2026-04-17 · lint: pass · typecheck: clean · tests: 23/23 pass (2 fixed, were failing at session start)
  - Scope creep absorbed from T-015: fixed L329 + L398 isActive assertions broken since T-015 middleware migration
  - usage-tracking.service.test.ts subtask deferred to T-022 integration (user-approved option B — coverage by equivalence with limit-enforcement)
  - Blocked by: T-014, T-015 · Blocks: none

### Cron Job (US-007)

- [x] **T-025** (complexity: 2.5) — Create archive-expired-promotions cron job handler
  - COMPLETED 2026-04-18 · lint: pass · typecheck: pass (no new errors in apps/api) · tests: deferred to T-026
  - Handler file: `apps/api/src/cron/jobs/archive-expired-promotions.job.ts` (205 lines)
  - Advisory lock: `pg_try_advisory_xact_lock(43010)` (transaction-level per advisory-locks.md rule; spec-deviation flagged in state.json `_specDeviation`)
  - Uses `withTransaction` + discriminated union (addon-expiry template)
  - `updatedById: null` safe: column is nullable (verified against `owner_promotions.dbschema.ts:33`)
  - Handler NOT yet registered in cron registry — T-026 scope
  - Blocked by: T-012 · Blocks: T-026

- [x] **T-026** (complexity: 2.5) — Register cron job + advisory lock docs + tests
  - COMPLETED 2026-04-18 · lint: pass · typecheck: pass · tests: 8/8 pass
  - Registered `archiveExpiredPromotionsJob` in `apps/api/src/cron/jobs/index.ts` barrel + `apps/api/src/cron/registry.ts` array (appended to end)
  - `packages/db/docs/advisory-locks.md` row 43010 Owner File updated to concrete handler path (row 43001 already concrete from SPEC-064)
  - Test file: `apps/api/test/cron/archive-expired-promotions.test.ts` (flat path, NOT `test/cron/jobs/`). 8 tests (6 core + 2 scope-bonus: job metadata + updatedAt freshness). Top-level error test also verifies Sentry.captureException tags.
  - Mocking: chainable vi.fn() stubs + withTransaction passthrough with tx stub acquired=true; tests override via `mockImplementationOnce` with `as never` cast for lock-not-acquired path. Pattern mirrors addon-expiry.test.ts.

## Suggested Start

Three independent tasks can start in parallel:

1. **T-001** (complexity: 2) — AccommodationReview schema + access verification tests (Phase 1)
2. **T-002** (complexity: 2) — AccommodationReview CRUD + admin-search verification tests (Phase 1)
3. **T-003** (complexity: 2) — OwnerPromotion DB schema update (unblocks Phase 2 entirely)

Recommended first: **T-003** — it has zero dependencies and unblocks 3 tasks immediately (T-004, T-007, T-011), forming the backbone of Phase 2.
