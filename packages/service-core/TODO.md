## Implementation Guidelines

### General Rules
1. All improvements must maintain or enhance type safety
2. No breaking changes without proper deprecation
3. All changes must include tests
4. Documentation must be updated with changes
5. Performance impact must be measured

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all new functionality
- Integration tests for system-wide changes
- Performance tests for critical paths
- Documentation tests

### Documentation Requirements
- Update README.md with new features
- Add JSDoc comments for all public APIs
- Include examples in documentation
- Update architecture diagrams

## Success Metrics

### Code Quality
- 100% test coverage for new code
- No new technical debt
- All TODOs resolved or documented

### Performance
- No regression in response times
- Improved memory usage
- Better cache hit rates

### Maintenance
- Reduced duplicate code
- Improved error handling
- Better debugging capabilities

## Review Process

### For Each Improvement
1. Create detailed design document
2. Get team review and approval
3. Implement in small, reviewable PRs
4. Update tests and documentation
5. Perform thorough testing
6. Deploy and monitor

## Priority Levels

- **P0 (Critical)**: Must be fixed immediately
- **P1 (High)**: Should be fixed in current sprint
- **P2 (Medium)**: Plan for next 1-2 sprints
- **P3 (Low)**: Nice to have, schedule when possible

## Resource Requirements

### Development
- 1-2 senior developers for architecture changes
- 1-2 developers for implementation
- 1 QA engineer for testing

### Infrastructure
- Test environment for performance testing
- Monitoring setup for new metrics
- Documentation hosting

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks
