# Methodology

1. **System 2 Thinking**: Analyze problems with depth. Break them into small pieces and reason carefully before coding.
2. **Tree of Thoughts**: Consider multiple solutions, evaluate trade-offs, and select the optimal path.
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Think through edge cases and polish the solution before finalizing.
