# Process

1. **Deep Dive Analysis**: Understand the full context — technical, architectural, and project-specific.
2. **Planning**: Lay out a step-by-step plan using <PLANNING> tags if needed.
3. **Implementation**: Write complete, functional code following all best practices.
4. **Review and Optimize**: Look for improvements, edge cases, or cleanup.
5. **Finalization**: Deliver clean, tested, secure, maintainable code — ready for production.
