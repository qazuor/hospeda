# Markdown Rules

- Use clear, hierarchical headings (H1, H2, H3, etc.).
- Prefer ordered and unordered lists for clarity.
- Keep content concise and well-structured.
- Use code blocks for code samples and inline code for references.
- Add links and images with descriptive alt text.


## 📝 Cursor Rules — Markdown Files (`.md` / `.mdx`)

These rules apply to all Markdown or MDX files, including blog posts, documentation, content pages, or inline notes.

---

### 🧠 General Guidelines

- Write clean, readable, and well-structured content.
- Prioritize semantic structure using proper headings (`#`, `##`, `###`, etc.).
- Always start with a single `# Title`, followed by a short summary or intro paragraph.
- Follow consistent spacing: one empty line between blocks.

---

### 📐 Structure & Hierarchy

- Only one `#` per file (main title).
- Use `##`, `###`, `####` in correct hierarchical order.
- Never skip heading levels (e.g., go from `##` to `####`).

```md
# Guide to Destinations

## Overview

### Key Features

### How to Book
```

---

### 🔠 Typography Rules

- Use `**bold**` for emphasis, not for decoration.
- Use `_italic_` or `*italic*` sparingly, only for terms or subtle emphasis.
- Use `> blockquotes` for quotes or tips — don’t abuse them.
- Use backticks for inline code: ``useState``, not *useState*.

---

### 📦 Code Blocks

- Always specify the language:  
  \`\`\`ts, \`\`\`js, \`\`\`bash, etc.
- Keep code blocks short and relevant.
- Add comments inside code when needed.

```ts
// ✅ Good example
const result = calculateTotal(price, taxRate);
```

---

### 🔗 Links & Media

- Use descriptive text for links:
  - ✅ `[See full documentation](mdc:https:/example.com/docs)`
  - ❌ `[click here](mdc:https:/example.com/docs)`
- Always use relative links for internal pages.
- Images must include alt text:
  ```md
  ![A tourist walking through Villa Elisa](mdc:https:/...)
  ```

---

### 🌐 SEO & Metadata

- All markdown files that represent pages (e.g., blog posts) must include frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Exploring Federación"
description: "Discover hot springs, lakes and natural beauty in Federación, Entre Ríos."
date: 2025-06-01
tags: ["destinations", "federación", "travel"]
featured: true
image: "/images/posts/federacion.jpg"
---
```

- Keep `description` between 130–160 characters.
- Use `tags` for filtering and related content features.
- Always set `featured` and `image` for blog posts or landing pages.

---

### 🧠 Content Quality

- Use short paragraphs (2–4 lines max).
- Use lists (`-` or `1.`) for clarity when enumerating.
- Avoid wall-of-text content — split into sections with `##` headings.
- Write in active voice and clear tone.

---

### 🧪 Content Review

- Check spelling and grammar.
- Read the file in preview to verify formatting and readability.
- Confirm all links, images, and code blocks render correctly.
- Validate frontmatter with your Astro content collection schema (if applicable).

---

### ⚠️ Forbidden in Markdown

- ❌ Inline HTML (`<div>`, `<span>`, etc.) unless absolutely needed in `.mdx`.
- ❌ Styling with inline tags (`<b>`, `<i>`, `<font>`, etc.).
- ❌ Using `style=""` or `class=""` in markdown.
- ❌ Empty headings or heading spam (`###` without content).

---

### ✅ TL;DR

- One `#` title per file.
- Use semantic heading structure.
- Always write clean, accessible, SEO-ready content.
- Use code blocks and links correctly.
- Add proper frontmatter in content pages.
