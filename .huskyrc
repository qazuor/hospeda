# Husky Configuration
# Controls which Git hooks are enabled/disabled
#
# Usage:
#   - Set to "1" to enable a hook
#   - Set to "0" to disable a hook
#   - Comment out to use default (enabled)
#
# You can also disable all hooks temporarily with:
#   export HUSKY=0
#
# Or skip hooks for a single commit with:
#   git commit --no-verify

# Pre-commit hook (format, lint, validate docs)
# Runs: markdown format, .claude validation, Biome, TODO sync
# Speed: ~5-15s depending on staged files
HUSKY_PRE_COMMIT=1

# Commit-msg hook (validate conventional commits)
# Runs: commitlint validation
# Speed: <1s
HUSKY_COMMIT_MSG=1

# Post-checkout hook (registry consistency check)
# Runs: code registry validation, staleness check
# Speed: <2s
HUSKY_POST_CHECKOUT=1

# Global hook controls
# Uncomment to disable all hooks (overrides individual settings)
# HUSKY=0

# Development mode
# Uncomment to skip slow operations (keeps fast checks)
# HUSKY_DEV_MODE=1
