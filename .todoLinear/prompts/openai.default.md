{{$languageInstructions}}

Analyze the following TODO comment and provide a detailed JSON response:

**File:** {{$filePath}}
**Line:** {{$lineNumber}}
**Comment:** {{$comment}}
**Code Context:**

```
{{$beforeContext}}
{{$afterContext}}
```

**Project Context:**

- File Type: {{$fileType}}

Provide your analysis in this exact JSON format:

```json
{
  "priority": "low|medium|high|critical",
  "description": {
    "why": "Explanation of why this TODO exists and its importance",
    "how": "Suggested approach or steps to implement this",
    "impact": "What impact completing this will have on the codebase"
  },
  "effort": "small|medium|large|epic",
  "labels": ["relevant", "tags", "for", "organization"],
  "relatedFiles": ["list", "of", "potentially", "affected", "files"],
  "suggestions": ["specific", "actionable", "recommendations"],

}
```

**Analysis Guidelines:**

- Be specific and actionable in your suggestions
- Consider the code context and project structure
- Estimate effort realistically based on the scope
- Identify potential risks or dependencies
- Suggest relevant labels for organization
- Keep confidence between 0.1 and 1.0 based on context clarity
