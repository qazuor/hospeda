# E2E Nightly Failure Audit — 2026-05-13

_Generated as part of SPEC-105 T-105-01 (Phase 0: audit past nightly failures)._

---

## Summary

All 11 nightly E2E runs (2026-05-02 → 2026-05-12) failed with the **same two root causes**. The test suite itself **never executed** — everything was blocked at the build step. This is the best-case scenario from the spec's probability table (~20% — trivial infra drift, not schema drift).

## Root Cause 1 — Wrong Turbo filter: `hospeda-admin` (INFRA DRIFT)

**Error message:**

```
x No package found with name 'hospeda-admin' in workspace
```

**Step:** `Build apps`

**Cause:** The admin app package was renamed from `hospeda-admin` to `admin` (see `apps/admin/package.json`). The workflow still referenced the old name via `--filter=hospeda-admin`.

**Status at staging HEAD (b90adbf5a):** Already fixed — the current `e2e-nightly.yml` now uses `--filter=admin`. The fix landed in staging _after_ the cron was disabled on 2026-05-12, so it never ran.

**Fix applied in:** Already in `main`/`staging` as of branch cut. No action needed for this root cause.

---

## Root Cause 2 — Wrong CI script paths: `scripts/ci/` prefix (INFRA DRIFT)

**Error messages:**

```
bash: scripts/ci/check-raw-ilike.sh: No such file or directory
Process completed with exit code 127.
```

**Step:** `Run CI scripts (raw-ilike + SEO + sitemap)`

**Cause:** The scripts were reorganized. The `scripts/ci/` subdirectory no longer exists; scripts were moved/renamed to the root `scripts/` dir:

| Workflow (stale) | Actual path | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `scripts/ci/check-raw-ilike.sh` | `scripts/check-unsafe-ilike.sh` | Renamed |
| `scripts/ci/seo-validator.ts` | `scripts/seo-validator.ts` | Moved |
| `scripts/ci/sitemap-validator.ts` | `scripts/sitemap-validator.ts` | Moved |

Reference: `ci.yml` line 188 uses `bash scripts/check-unsafe-ilike.sh` — that confirms the correct path.

**Status:** NOT yet fixed in `e2e-nightly.yml`. This is the remaining blocker.

**Fix needed:** Update the `Run CI scripts` step in `.github/workflows/e2e-nightly.yml`.

---

## Findings: no credential drift, no schema/API drift detected

- All secrets (`HOSPEDA_BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, `HOSPEDA_MERCADO_PAGO_*`, `HOSPEDA_CLOUDINARY_*`) were present in the job env (masked by Actions — not empty). No credential expiry evidence.
- `apps/e2e/.env.e2e` — port assignments and URLs look correct; no drift detected.
- Package names `hospeda-api`, `hospeda-web`, `hospeda-e2e` unchanged — only `admin` was renamed.
- The test suite was never reached, so schema/API drift in test assertions is **unknown** and must be verified in Phase 1 (T-105-02 — local repro).

---

## Fixes applied — T-105-05 (infra drift)

1. Fix `.github/workflows/e2e-nightly.yml` — CI scripts step paths (Root Cause 2). ✅ Commit 5b0515350.

---

## Phase 1 drift analysis — T-105-02 (2026-06-25)

Static drift analysis via Explore subagent revealed 4 schema/API drifts in test assertions.
All 4 fixed in this branch (see T-105-04 section below).

Commerce @p0 selectors (`.mc-list__name`, `.mc-list__edit`, `#ce-menuUrl`, `#ce-richDescription`,
`.gastro-contact__menu-btn`, `.exp-info__body`) validated against current web components — all present.

`host-07e` cron endpoint drift (removed VPS migration endpoint `/api/v1/cron/...`) is guarded by
`test.fixme` — will not block the nightly run but remains deferred technical debt.

---

## Schema/API drift fixes — T-105-04 (2026-06-25)

### DRIFT-2 — `apps/e2e/fixtures/api-helpers.ts` `createConversation()`

**Issue:** INSERT used non-existent columns `guest_user_id` and `host_user_id`. The `conversations`
table has `user_id` (nullable FK for authenticated guest) and derives the host from
`accommodations.owner_id`. Status `'ACTIVE'` is not a valid enum value; correct value is `'OPEN'`.

**Fix:** Removed `hostUserId` option, changed SQL to `user_id`, status to `'OPEN'`.

### DRIFT-3 — `apps/e2e/tests/messaging/msg-01-conversation.spec.ts:96`

**Issue:** Host inbox checked via `GET /api/v1/protected/conversations` (guest inbox, filtered by
`user_id` = actor.id). A host querying this returns an empty list. Host inbox is at
`/api/v1/protected/conversations/owner`. Also: response type was `{ data?: Array<...> }` but
paginated response is `{ data: { items: [...], pagination: {...} } }`.

**Fix:** Changed endpoint to `/conversations/owner`; updated response type and `.map()` to `.items?.map()`.

### DRIFT-4 — `apps/e2e/tests/spec-096/e2e-10-filter-cache-hit.spec.ts`

**Issue:** `GET /api/v1/public/accommodations` returns `{ data: { items: [...], pagination: {...} } }`
(paginated). Test typed response as `{ data?: ReadonlyArray<...> }` and called `data?.map()`,
which silently returned `[]` (undefined method on object), making all assertions vacuously pass.

**Fix:** Added `PaginatedBody` type; changed all `.data?.map()` to `.data?.items?.map()`.

### DRIFT-5 — `apps/e2e/tests/spec-098/e2e-08-entity-smoke.spec.ts`

**Issue:** `GET /api/v1/protected/user-bookmarks` returns `{ data: { bookmarks: [...], total: N } }`.
`BookmarkListResponse` typed `data` as `ReadonlyArray<...>` and called `data?.some(...)`, which
throws `TypeError: data.some is not a function` at runtime (plain object, not array).

**Fix:** Updated `BookmarkListResponse` to `{ data?: { bookmarks: ReadonlyArray<...>; total: number } }`;
changed `data?.some(...)` to `data?.bookmarks?.some(...)`.

## Cron re-enable — T-105-06

Cron re-enabled at `0 5 * * *` (02:00 ART = 05:00 UTC). Spec complete when 3 consecutive
nightly runs succeed.

---

## Root Cause 3 — step order regression (found post-PR #1856, 2026-07-01)

Every nightly run since reactivation (2026-06-28 → 2026-07-02, 5/5 runs) failed identically,
never reaching the E2E suite:

**Error:**

```
[1/26] 001-search-index.matview.sql ... FAIL
  Error: relation "accommodations" does not exist
```

**Step:** `Apply Postgres extras`

**Cause:** `.github/workflows/e2e-nightly.yml` ran `Apply Postgres extras` before
`Push Drizzle schema to E2E database` — the extras SQL (matviews/CHECK constraints) reference
tables the Drizzle push hasn't created yet. A second, unrelated regression shipped in the same
window: the T-105-05 script-path fix pointed CI scripts at `scripts/*-validator.ts` when the
real location is `scripts/ci/*-validator.ts`.

**Fix:** commit `3c0fa4a1c` (PR #1972, merged to `staging` 2026-07-01) reorders the steps
(schema push first, extras second) and corrects the script paths.

**Promotion gap:** the nightly cron always runs against whatever is on `main` at trigger time
(`headBranch: main` on every scheduled run — GitHub Actions resolves scheduled-workflow content
from the repo's default branch, not `staging`). The fix landed on `staging` 2026-07-01 but
wasn't promoted to `main` until PR #1986 (`chore: promote staging to main`), merged
2026-07-02T06:49:20Z — 33 minutes _after_ that morning's nightly run (2026-07-02T06:16Z) had
already failed against the pre-fix commit. Both the 2026-07-01 and 2026-07-02 runs used the same
stale `main` commit (`eb6d43f`), predating the fix.

**Status:** fix is on `main` as of 2026-07-02T06:49Z. No nightly run has exercised it yet — the
next scheduled run (2026-07-03 ~05:00 UTC) is the first real test.

**Process note:** any future infra fix to `e2e-nightly.yml` must be promoted `staging` → `main`
before the next 05:00 UTC trigger to take effect, since the cron never reads `staging` directly.

| Root cause | Type | Status |
|---|---|---|
| RC-3: `Apply Postgres extras` ran before schema push | Infra | ✅ Fixed on `main` (2026-07-02T06:49Z), unverified by a live run |
