# Adding a New Entitlement — Contributor Guide

> Spec reference: SPEC-145 T-145-20 | Authored: 2026-06-05

This guide walks through every step required to add a new entitlement key
end-to-end. Follow all six steps; skipping any one of them will break CI.

---

## Step 1: Add the enum member

File: `packages/billing/src/types/entitlement.types.ts`

Add a new `EntitlementKey` member:

```ts
export enum EntitlementKey {
    // ...existing members...
    MY_NEW_FEATURE = 'my_new_feature',
}
```

The two runtime guards (`isEntitlementKey` / `isLimitKey` in
`packages/billing/src/types/guards.ts`) iterate `Object.values(EntitlementKey)`,
so no manual update is needed there. The new key is automatically valid.

---

## Step 2: Add the human-readable definition

File: `packages/billing/src/config/entitlements.config.ts`

Append an entry to `ENTITLEMENT_DEFINITIONS`:

```ts
{
    key: EntitlementKey.MY_NEW_FEATURE,
    name: 'My new feature',
    description: 'One-sentence description for the admin plan editor and billing UI',
},
```

This array is the seeder's source of truth for the `billing_entitlements` lookup
table. See the **Seed sync** note below.

---

## Step 3: Grant the entitlement in plan config (and understand DB sync)

File: `packages/billing/src/config/plans.config.ts`

Add the new key to the `entitlements` array of each plan that should receive it:

```ts
export const OWNER_PRO_PLAN: PlanDefinition = {
    // ...
    entitlements: [
        // ...existing keys...
        EntitlementKey.MY_NEW_FEATURE,
    ],
};
```

### How plan grants reach the billing DB (seed sync)

`plans.config.ts` is the **code-level config**. The billing DB (`billing_plans`
table managed by QZPay) is the **runtime source of truth** after initial seeding
(SPEC-168 / SPEC-192). The two are kept in sync as follows:

1. `packages/seed/src/required/billingEntitlements.seed.ts` reads
   `ENTITLEMENT_DEFINITIONS` and upserts rows in `billing_entitlements`. It is
   idempotent: existing rows are skipped (skip-by-key).

2. `packages/seed/src/required/billingPlans.seed.ts` reads `ALL_PLANS` and
   upserts rows in `billing_plans` (matched by `name`). On first run it inserts;
   on subsequent runs it detects divergences (compares `entitlements`, `limits`,
   `metadata`, `active`) and logs a warning — it **does NOT overwrite** runtime
   edits. This means: if a plan was already seeded and you add an entitlement to
   `plans.config.ts`, **the DB row does not update automatically**. You must
   either:

   - Run `pnpm db:fresh` (dev only — wipes and re-seeds from scratch), OR
   - Edit the plan from the admin panel (`/admin/billing/plans`), OR
   - Ask an operator to run the admin API mutation (`PUT /api/v1/admin/billing/plans/{id}`).

   For a brand-new environment the seed covers everything. For an existing
   environment (staging, prod) the admin UI or API is the correct path.

---

## Step 4: Gate the route

Import `requireEntitlement` and pass it in `options.middlewares` — that is the
only supported wiring point. Do **not** call `requireEntitlement` inside the
handler body.

File example: `apps/api/src/routes/accommodation/protected/create.ts`

```ts
import { EntitlementKey } from '@repo/billing';
import { requireEntitlement } from '../../../middlewares/entitlement';

export const protectedCreateAccommodationRoute = createProtectedRoute({
    // ...
    options: {
        middlewares: [
            requireEntitlement(EntitlementKey.PUBLISH_ACCOMMODATIONS),
            // limit check (if needed) comes after the entitlement gate
        ],
    },
});
```

The middleware chain order on every protected route is:

```
auth → actor → billing → billingCustomer → trial → [options.middlewares]
```

Key ordering invariants:

- `trialMiddleware` fires **before** `requireEntitlement`. An expired-trial user
  receives HTTP 402 before ever reaching the 403 entitlement gate (T-019 learning).
- Entitlement gate (403) always precedes limit check. Check the entitlement first
  so the limit counter is never queried for users who lack the feature entirely.
- Staff roles (`SUPER_ADMIN`, `ADMIN`, `EDITOR`, `CLIENT_MANAGER`) bypass
  entitlement checks via INV-6: `entitlementMiddleware` grants them the unlimited
  set before the route middleware runs. `requireEntitlement` sees their key in the
  set and passes.

### Error contract

`requireEntitlement` throws `ServiceError(ServiceErrorCode.ENTITLEMENT_REQUIRED)`.
The global `createErrorHandler()` maps this to HTTP 403 with body:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "ENTITLEMENT_REQUIRED",
    "message": "Access denied. This feature requires the 'my_new_feature' entitlement.",
    "details": { "requiredEntitlement": "my_new_feature", "upgradeUrl": "/billing/plans" }
  }
}
```

Never throw `HTTPException(403)` directly from a gate. Always use `ServiceError`.

---

## Step 5: Add a test pair (block + allow)

Pattern: `apps/api/test/e2e/flows/billing/enforcement-gates.test.ts`

Add one BLOCK case (a plan that lacks the key) and one ALLOW case (a plan that
has it). Both must exercise the real middleware stack end-to-end — no mocking of
`requireEntitlement` or `entitlementMiddleware`.

```ts
// Gate N: MY_NEW_FEATURE
//   Route:   POST /api/v1/protected/my-route
//   BLOCK:   tourist-free (lacks MY_NEW_FEATURE)
//   ALLOW:   owner-pro    (has  MY_NEW_FEATURE)

it('blocks when MY_NEW_FEATURE is absent (tourist-free)', async () => {
    // ... setup actor with tourist-free plan
    const res = await app.request('/api/v1/protected/my-route', { method: 'POST', ... });
    expect(res.status).toBe(403);
    const body = await res.json();
    expect(body.error.code).toBe('ENTITLEMENT_REQUIRED');
});

it('passes when MY_NEW_FEATURE is present (owner-pro)', async () => {
    // ... setup actor with owner-pro plan
    const res = await app.request('/api/v1/protected/my-route', { method: 'POST', ... });
    // Gate must not fire — downstream 4xx for missing data is acceptable
    expect(res.status).not.toBe(403);
});
```

---

## Step 6: Add a row to the gate matrix

File: `docs/billing/endpoint-gate-matrix.md`

Add a row to the **Route Gate Matrix** table under the appropriate section:

```
| `POST /api/v1/protected/my-route` | `my-entity/protected/create.ts` | gate | `my_new_feature` | wired | requireEntitlement(MY_NEW_FEATURE) middleware wired (SPEC-NNN) |
```

The snapshot guard test (`apps/api/test/middlewares/endpoint-gate-matrix.guard.test.ts`,
SPEC-145 T-022) parses this table on every CI run. If a protected or admin route
handler file exists on disk without a matching matrix row, CI fails with an
explicit error message listing the missing file. Conversely, a matrix row that
points at a non-existent file also fails.

**New route with no gate:** set Decision = `none` and write a clear Reason —
the guard requires it.

---

## Gating an existing previously-ungated route

If you are adding an entitlement gate to a **route that already exists and was
previously ungated**, callers on plans that lack the key will start receiving
HTTP 403 where they previously got 2xx. This is a behavior change; document it
in `docs/billing/spec-145-behavior-changes.md` following the existing inventory
format. Cite the blocked tiers and link the owner decision if the lockout is
intentional (example: the WRITE_REVIEWS host-lockout documented in that file).
