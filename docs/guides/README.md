## What Are Guides?

Guides are **practical, hands-on tutorials** that walk you through completing a specific task from start to finish. Unlike API reference documentation, guides focus on:

- Step-by-step instructions
- Real-world examples
- Best practices
- Common pitfalls to avoid
- Testing strategies

## When to Use Guides

Use guides when you need to:

- Learn how to implement a new feature
- Understand the workflow for a specific task
- Follow established patterns and conventions
- See working code examples in context

## Guide Format

Each guide follows a consistent structure:

1. **Overview** - What you'll build and why
2. **Prerequisites** - What you need to know/have installed
3. **Step-by-Step Instructions** - Detailed implementation
4. **Testing** - How to test your implementation
5. **Common Issues** - Troubleshooting tips
6. **Next Steps** - Where to go from here
